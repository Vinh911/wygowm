# WYGOWM Project

## DEMO

## Overview

This quick project was created as a Valentine's Day gift. It's a playful web application that asks a simple question: "Will you go out with me?". The twist? The "No" button playfully avoids the cursor, making it a fun and interactive way to share a moment together, even when miles apart.
(I also have not written javascript in forever lol)

## How to Use

To experience this project, just open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. Move your mouse over the "No" button and watch it jump across the screen. It's a simple interaction, but one that I hope brings a smile to your face.
